Yesterday, I was listening to a really cool song called $The Name of a Song 01$$ when $A Person's Name 02$$ texted me. I couldn't belive it! I hadn't head from $A Person's Name 02$$ since I $A Past Tense Verb 03$$ three $A Plural Unit of Time 04$$ ago! Of course, I messaged $A Person's Name 02$$ back right away. We ended up talking about $A Pluarl Noun 05$$ for hours, and we agreed to meet up sometime next $A Unit of Time 06$$. I really want to go to $A Restuarunt 07$$, but $A Person's Name 02$$ wants to see $A Popular Movie 08$$ instead. I think I'm starting to remember why I haven't seen $A Person's Name 02$$ in so long. Regardless, I'm really looking forward to seeing $A Person's Name 02$$ again!
