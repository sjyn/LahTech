When I was a senior at $Name of a High School 01$$ High School, I was interested in becoming the president of the school's $Name of a Club 02$$ club. The only person standing in my way was my arch-nemisis, $A Person's name 03$$. $A Person's name 03$$ and I had been enemies since the third grade, when they $A Past Tense Verb 04$$ me on the playground. I had been campaigning for two $A Unit of Time 05$$ and finally it was the day of the election. $A Person's name 03$$ and I went to the $A Place 06$$ to give our speeches to the student body. $A Person's name 03$$ went first, and their speech was really good. They talked about $A Trending Topic 07$$ and how they hated $A Controversial Issue 08$$, and ended on how they wanted to see $An Everyday Occurance 09$$ change. I was nervous when I went up to the podium; $A Person's name 03$$'s speech was really good. I choked when I got up there! All I could say was that I liked $A Popular Thing 10$$. I walked away feeling $An Emotion 11$$. I didn't win, but neither did $A Person's name 03$$! It turns out that there was a third person, $A Person's name 12$$, who won the election.
