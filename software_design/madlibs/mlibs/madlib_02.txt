When I was younger, my older sister, $A Person's Name 01$$, wanted to become a $An Occupation 02$$. My sister decided that she would train for her job by using my favorite stuffed $A Type of Animal 03$$. I didn't notice that $A Pet's Name 04$$ (my stuffed $A Type of Animal 03$$) was missing until $A Time of Day 05$$. My sister and I were at the $A Place 06$$ playing $A Game 07$$ when I noticed that $A Pet's Name 04$$ wasn't where I had left it, and that $A Person's Name 01$$ had mysteriously diappeared. I told my $A Type of Relative 08$$ that I thought $A Person's Name 01$$ had stolen $A Pet's Name 04$$, but my $A Type of Relative 08$$ just $A Past Tense Verb 09$$ and said I was being $An Adverb 10$$. I knew the truth, and I ran back to my $A Place 11$$. I was too late though! $A Person's Name 01$$ had already $A Past Tense Verb 12$$ it! My sister apologized to me and told me she would buy me a new stuffed $A Type of Animal 03$$. She did, and I named it $A Pet's Name 13$$.
