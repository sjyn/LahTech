# LahTech
It's pronounced Lay Tech.  
This is a repo dedicated to the study guides I make every so often to help me with my classes. I love LaTeX, and I wanted to have some helpful resources for later when I need to remember all this stuff.

### cheatsheets
In this folder are several overview sheets that are very helpful for jumping straight to the answer. It is, of course, very helpful to actually know from where the answers came, but sometimes it's also very helpful to not spend 20 minutes deriving the formal solution the the 2D wave equation as well.

### comporg
I had to take a computer architecture class, and I needed to review. What better way than typesetting all the test reviews in LaTex?

### osi
This repository focuses on my operating systems class. We covered mostly processor scheduling, so that's what the review focuses on.

### pde
Partial Differential Equations.

### proofs
This was a simple introductory course to proofs. I have a take home test and a final review there.

### wim
I had to take a writing intensive course. There is a final paper and some ruby scripts as well.

### Computer Architecture
The programming portion of the class only dealt with MIPS assembly, so the .asm files are all MIPS assembly written in the MARS environment.

### C++ Programming
The programs for this course were primarily written using Visual Studio 2015. The only exception is the exam question file, which we written in a UNIX environment (hence the shell script that runs UNIX commands to compile and clean the directory).
### Programming Language Concepts
This was a course in several programming languages that focused on the ideas behind the languages rather than the languages themselves. Excluded from the repository are a C# script and a rather in depth PHP assignment.
