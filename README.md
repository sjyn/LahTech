# LahTech
It's pronounced Lay Tech.  
This is a repo dedicated to the study guides I make every so often to help me with my classes. I love LaTeX, and I wanted to have some helpful resources for later when I need to remember all this stuff.

### cheatsheets
In this folder are several overview sheets that are very helpful for jumping straight to the answer. It is, of course, very helpful to actually know from where the answers came, but sometimes it's also very helpful to not spend 20 minutes deriving the formal solution the the 2D wave equation as well.

### comporg
I had to take a computer architecture class, and I needed to review. What better way than typesetting all the test reviews in LaTex?

### osi
This repository focuses on my operating systems class. We covered mostly processor scheduling, so that's what the review focuses on.

### pde
Partial Differential Equations.

### proofs
This was a simple introductory course to proofs. I have a take home test and a final review there.

### wim
I had to take a writing intensive course. There is a final paper and some ruby scripts as well.
